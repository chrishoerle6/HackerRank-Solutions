	Two people are playing game of Mis√®re Nim. The basic rules for this 
	game are as follows:
	- The game starts with n piles of stones indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each 
	  pile i (where 0 <= i < n) has s_i (subscript) stones.
	- The players move in alternating turns. During each move, the current 
	  player must remove one or more stones from a single pile.
	- The player who removes the last stone loses the game.

	Given the value of n and the number of stones in each pile, determine 
	whether the person who wins the game is the first or second person to 
	move. If the first player to move wins, print First on a new line; otherwise, 
	print Second. Assume both players move optimally.

	Example:
	s = [1, 1, 1]
	In this case, player 1 picks a pile, player 2 picks a pile and player 1 has 
	to choose the last pile. Player 2 wins so return Second.

	s = [1, 2, 2]
	There is no permutation of optimal moves where player 2 wins. For example, 
	player 1 chooses the first pile. If player 2 chooses 1 from another pile, 
	player 1 will choose the pile with 2 left. If player 2 chooses a pile of 2, 
	player 1 chooses 1 from the remaining pile leaving the last stone for player 2. 
	Return First.

	Function Description:
	Complete the misereNim function in the editor below.

	misereNim has the following parameters:
	int s[n]: the number of stones in each pile
	
	Returns:
	string: either First or Second
	
	Input Format:
	The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
	Each test case is described over two lines:
	1, An integer, n, the number of piles.
	2, n space-separated integers, s[i], that describe the number of stones at pile i.
	
	Constraints:
	1 <= T <= 100
	1 <= n <= 100
	1 <= s[i] <= 10^9

	Sample Input:
	STDIN   Function
	-----   --------
	2       T = 2
	2       s[] size n = 2
	1 1     s = [1, 1]
	3       s[] size n = 3
	2 1 3   s = [2, 1, 3]
	
	Sample Output:
	First
	Second
	
	Explanation:
	In the first testcase, the first player removes 1 stone from the first pile and 
	then the second player has no moves other than removing the only stone in the 
	second pile. So first wins.
	In the second testcase, in every possible move of first player we see that the 
	last stone is picked by him, so second player wins.
