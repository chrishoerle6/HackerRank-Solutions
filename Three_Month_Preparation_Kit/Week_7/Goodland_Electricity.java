	Goodland is a country with a number of evenly spaced cities along a line. 
	The distance between adjacent cities is 1 unit. There is an energy infrastructure 
	project planning meeting, and the government needs to know the fewest number of 
	power plants needed to provide electricity to the entire list of cities. Determine 
	that number. If it cannot be done, return -1.
	You are given a list of city data. Cities that may contain a power plant have been 
	labeled 1. Others not suitable for building a plant are labeled 0. Given a 
	distribution range of k, find the lowest number of plants that must be built such 
	that all cities are served. The distribution range limits supply to cities where 
	distance is less than k.

	Example:
	k = 3
	arr = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
	Each city is 1 unit distance from its neighbors, and we'll use 0 based indexing. 
	We see there are 3 cities suitable for power plants, cities 1, 2 and 3. If we build 
	a power plant at arr[2], it can serve arr[0] through arr[4] because those endpoints 
	are at a distance of 2 and 2 < k. To serve arr[6], we would need to be able to build 
	a plant in city 4, 5 or 6. Since none of those is suitable, we must return -1. It 
	cannot be done using the current distribution constraint.

	Function Description:
	Complete the pylons function in the editor below.

	pylons has the following parameter(s):
	int k: the distribution range
	int arr[n]: each city's suitability as a building site
	
	Returns:
	int: the minimum number of plants required or -1
	
	Input Format:
	The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k, the number of cities 
	in Goodland and the plants' range constant.
	The second line contains n space-separated binary integers where each integer indicates 
	suitability for building a plant.

	Constraints:
	1 <= k <= n <= 10^5
	Each arr[i] E {0, 1}.
	
	Subtask:
	1 <= k <= n <= 1000 for 40% of the maximum score.
	
	Output Format:

	Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of plants that must be built so 
	that all of Goodland's cities have electricity. If this is not possible for the given 
	value of k, print -1.

	Sample Input:
	STDIN         Function
	-----         --------
	6 2           arr[] size n = 6, k = 2
	0 1 1 1 1 0   arr = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
	
	Sample Output:
	2
	
	Explanation:
	Cities c[1], c[2], c[3], and c[4] are suitable for power plants. Each plant will have 
	a range of k = 2. If we build in cities 2 cities, c[1] and c[4], then all cities will 
	have electricity.
